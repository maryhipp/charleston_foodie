#Charleston Foodie

##Overview

I built Charleston Foodie as a way to easily scope out the local food scene in Charleston depending on what you're in the mood for. Also to sharpen backbone.js skills on top of Ruby on Rails app.


##Technologies Used
* Ruby 2.1.1
* Rails 4.1.1
* PostgreSQL Database
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone.js") for JavaScript framework
* [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)

##User Stories Completed
* User can search for local restaurants based off keyword search with no page refresh
